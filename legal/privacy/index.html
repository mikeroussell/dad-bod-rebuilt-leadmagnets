Your privacy is very important to us. We want to make your experience on the Internet as enjoyable and rewarding as possible, and we want you to use the Internet's vast array of information, tools, and opportunities with complete confidence.
</p>
<p>
We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and security. This Privacy Policy describes how Janus Nutrition, LLC collects information from all end users of our Internet services—those who access some of our Services but do not have accounts ("Visitors") as well as those who may purchase Products and/or subscribe to our services ("Members")—what we do with the information we collect, and the choices Visitors and Members have concerning the collection and use of such information.
</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-black mt-10 mb-4">Personal Information We Collect and How It Is Used</h2>
<p>
We collect information in different ways from Visitors and Members who access the various parts of our Services. We use this information primarily to provide a customized experience as you use our Products and Services, and generally, do not share this information with third parties. However, we may disclose personal information collected if we have received your permission beforehand or in very special circumstances, such as when we believe that such disclosure is required by law.
</p>

<h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-black mt-8 mb-3">Registration</h3>
<p>
Members may be asked to provide certain personal information when they sign up for our Products or Services including name, address, telephone number, billing information (such as a credit card number), and email address. The personal information collected from Members during the registration process is used to manage each Member's account (such as for billing purposes). This information is not shared with third parties, unless specifically stated otherwise or in special circumstances.
</p>

<h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-black mt-8 mb-3">Online Shopping</h3>
<p>
When you purchase products and services, you may be asked to provide contact information, such as your name, address, email address, phone number, and credit/debit card information. If you order services or products directly from our company, we will use the personal information you provide only to process that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.
</p>

<h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-brand-black mt-8 mb-3">Email Communications</h3>
<p>
When Visitors or Members send email inquiries to our company, the return email address is used to answer the email inquiry we receive. Our company does not use the return email address for any other purpose and does not share the return email address with any third party.
</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-black mt-10 mb-4">Cookies</h2>
<p>
A "cookie" is a small data file that can be placed on your hard drive when you visit certain websites. Our company may use cookies to collect, store, and sometimes track information for statistical purposes to improve the products and services we provide. If you are a Visitor or Member, we may use a cookie to save your settings and to provide customizable and personalized services.
</p>
